## Conditional Statements: Positive Number Checker
## Aim
To write a C program that reads a value A from the user and checks whether it is a positive number or not.

## Algorithm
Declare a variable to store the input value A.

Use the scanf function to read the value of A from the user.

Check if the value of A is greater than zero.

If A is greater than zero, print a message indicating that it's a positive number.

Otherwise, print a message indicating that it's not a positive number.

End the program.
