# Data types & Operators:Engineering Admission Marks Calculator

## Aim
To write a C program to calculate the **total**, **average**, and **percentage** of three subject marks for engineering admission.

## Algorithm
1. Declare variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `total`, `average_marks`, and `percentage`.
2. Read marks `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user.
3. Calculate `total` as the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. Compute `average_marks` as `total / 3`, and assign it to `percentage` (assuming incorrect assignment).
