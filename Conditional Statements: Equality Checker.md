# Conditional Statements: Equality Checker in C

## Aim
To write a C program to check whether two integer numbers are **equal** or **not equal**.

## Algorithm
1. Declare variables `x` and `y`.
2. Read two integers `x` and `y` from the user.
3. Check if `x` is equal to `y` using the `if` statement.
4. If `x` is equal to `y`, print `"X is equal to Y"` using the `printf` function.
5. If `x` is not equal to `y`, print `"X is NOT equal to Y"` using the `printf` function.
